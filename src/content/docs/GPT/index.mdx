# What is GPT?

**GPT** (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a family of large language models developed by **OpenAI**.  
These models excel at generating natural language, answering questions, and performing reasoning tasks, thanks to training on vast amounts of text data.

GPT models are widely used for **chatbots, content creation, coding assistance, data analysis**, and more.

## Key features

- **Natural language understanding and generation**
- **Strong reasoning abilities**
- **Multi-turn conversation handling**
- **Multilingual support**
- **API and tool integration** (functions, retrieval-augmented generation)



---

## Strengths

- Versatile across **many domains** (technical, creative, analytical)
- Excellent for **structured output** (tables, JSON, formatted reports)
- Strong **code generation and debugging** abilities
- Works well with **role-based prompting**

---

## Limitations

- May produce plausible but incorrect information (**hallucinations**)
- Can be sensitive to prompt phrasing
- Default model may lack up-to-date real-world knowledge (unless connected to browsing or plugins)

---

## Best use cases

- **Conversational AI** for customer support
- **Content creation** (articles, marketing copy, scripts)
- **Code generation** in multiple programming languages
- **Data analysis** and summarization
- **Educational tools** and tutoring

---

## Prompting tips for GPT

- Use **clear, specific instructions** for better accuracy
- Set **output constraints** (word count, format, style)
- For complex tasks, **break them down into steps**
- Use **system messages** (if available) to define role and behavior
- Include **examples** for few-shot prompting when needed

---

## Model compatibility in this documentation

All prompts marked as **GPT-compatible** in this collection have been tested primarily with GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo.  
Many also work well with GPT-3.5, with slight adaptations.

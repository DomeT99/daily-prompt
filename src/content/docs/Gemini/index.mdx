# What is Gemini?

**Gemini** is a family of large language models developed by **Google DeepMind**, designed for **multimodal capabilities**, meaning it can process and generate text, images, code, and other data formats.  
It aims to combine **state-of-the-art reasoning** with **integration into Google’s ecosystem** and tools.

Gemini models are positioned as Google's successor to PaLM 2, with enhanced performance and broader application scope.

## Key features

- **Multimodal input and output** (text, images, audio, code, etc.)
- **Advanced reasoning and problem solving**
- **Strong integration** with Google tools and APIs
- **Large context window** in newer versions
- **Support for multiple languages** 

---

## Strengths

- Handles **text + image** tasks natively
- Excellent at **complex reasoning with mixed data types**
- Seamless integration into **Google Workspace** and developer tools
- Strong for **search-based and research-heavy** tasks

---

## Limitations

- Availability may be **region-limited**
- Model access often tied to **Google Cloud or Bard** services
- May prioritize **Google data sources** in responses

---

## Best use cases

- **Research assistance** combining text and visual data
- **Educational tools** with mixed media input
- **Automated reporting** combining structured and unstructured data
- **Search-enhanced Q&A** leveraging Google's knowledge base

---

## Prompting tips for Gemini

- Include **multimodal references** when relevant (images, links, etc.)
- Be explicit about **output format** when mixing text and visuals
- Break **complex multi-data tasks** into structured steps
- Leverage **Google Workspace integration** for workflow automation

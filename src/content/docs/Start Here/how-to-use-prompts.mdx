# First steps with prompts

Prompts are the **instructions, questions, or tasks** we give to large language models (LLMs). The way you write and structure your prompt directly affects the **accuracy, tone, and usefulness** of the model’s output.

This guide explains **how to use the prompts from this documentation**, how to adapt them for different scenarios, and how to avoid common mistakes.

## What is a prompt?

A **prompt** is not just text, it’s the *interface* between you and the model. It can contain:

- **Role or persona**: Telling the model *who* it should act as.
- **Context**: Background information or constraints.
- **Task**: The actual thing you want done.
- **Output format**: How you want the answer structured.

Example:

```text
You are an experienced technical writer.
Summarize the following documentation into 5 bullet points.
Use plain English and keep each bullet under 12 words.
```

It's important to be clear and specific in your prompts to get the best results.

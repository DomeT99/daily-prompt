# What is this project?

This documentation is a curated collection of **tested and ready-to-use prompts** designed for modern large language models (LLMs) such as **GPT-4**, **Claude 4**, **Mistral**, and others.

Each prompt is crafted to be **clear, reusable, and adaptable** across different use cases, from programming to content creation.

## Why a prompt collection?

While LLMs are incredibly powerful, **their output quality heavily depends on the input prompt**. This project was created to:

- Share effective, field-tested prompts
- Save time and avoid reinventing the wheel
- Promote better prompt engineering practices

## Who is this for?

This project is useful for:

- **Developers** integrating LLMs into apps
- **Content creators and marketers**
- **Researchers and data scientists**
- **Anyone** using LLMs regularly and looking for quality prompts
